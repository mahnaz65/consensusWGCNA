Consensus WGCNA: Multi-Region Co-Expression Network Analysis

This repository provides a step-by-step workflow for consensus Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) across multiple biological regions or conditions. The pipeline enables users to construct individual gene co-expression networks, build consensus networks, evaluate module overlaps, and assess module preservation across datasets. Each step is modularized and well-documented for easy reproducibility and adaptation to other multi-set transcriptomics studies.



The steps are as follows: 

[Individual network construction](1.Individual%20Network%20Construction.md)  

[Consensus Network Construction](2.%20Consensus%20Network%20Construction.md) 

[Module overlap analysis.md](3.module%20overlap%20analysis.md) 

[Module Preservation Analysis](4.Module%20Preservation%20Analysis.md)
